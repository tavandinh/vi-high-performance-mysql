Foreword
```
I’ve been a fan of this book for years, and the third edition makes a great book even
better. Not only do world-class experts share that expertise, but they have taken the
time to update and add chapters with high-quality writing. While the book has many
details on getting high performance from MySQL, the focus of the book is on the pro-
cess of improvement rather than facts and trivia. This book will help you figure out
how to make things better, regardless of changes in MySQL’s behavior over time.

The authors are uniquely qualified to write this book, based on their experience, prin-
cipled approach, focus on efficiency, and commitment to improvement. By _experi-
ence_ , I mean that the authors have been working on MySQL performance from the days
when it didn’t scale and had no instrumentation to the current period where things are
much better. By _principled approach_ , I mean that they treat this like a science, first
defining problems to be solved and then using reason and measurement to solve those
problems.

I am most impressed by their focus on _efficiency_. As consultants, they don’t have the
luxury of time. Clients getting billed by the hour want problems solved quickly. So the
authors have defined processes and built tools to get things done correctly and effi-
ciently. They describe the processes in this book and publish source code for the tools.

Finally, they continue to get better at what they do. This includes a shift in concern
from throughput to response time, a commitment to understanding the performance
of MySQL on new hardware, and a pursuit of new skills like queueing theory that can
be used to understand performance.

I believe this book augurs a bright future for MySQL. As MySQL has evolved to support
demanding workloads, the authors have led a similar effort to improve the under-
standing of MySQL performance within the community. They have also contributed
directly to that improvement via XtraDB and XtraBackup. I continue to learn from them
and hope you take the time to do so as well.
